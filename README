What if it could also decode an audio stream?
- Could this be done through the microphone?
- Could this be done from an MP3 (or some other format) file?

What if it could also convert text into a morse code audio stream (for a ring tone)?
- Unfortunately you can't gain access to the ringtone system programatically.
- You could still create the ringtone and then add it to your phone manually though.
